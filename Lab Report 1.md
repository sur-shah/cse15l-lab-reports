*cd*
```
No arguments
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
When using cd without any arguments it will automatically take the user to the home directory.
```
Directory as argument
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
```
When using cd with an argument of a directory it will bring the user to that directory
allowing them to access files or other directories within it.

```
File as an argument
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd Hello.java
bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory
```
Here when using a file as an argument for the cd command, it states that a file is not a directory meaning that it is unable to access said file.

*ls*
